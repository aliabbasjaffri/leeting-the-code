# leeting-the-code
- Lots of thanks to [neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) for providing a wonderful organised list of questions.
## background
- Rather than just attempting questions on leet-code and forgetting about them after a while, i decided to create this repo so that i can have a track of which questions that i have attempted and can easily go back to them for reference.
